# Breast cancer prediction model

This repository contains the code to develop an easy-to-interpret yet powerful breast cancer prediction model. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset (Wolberg et al., 1993) was used as the database. To ensure that all critical aspects of the project were considered, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) was followed. For this reason, the notebooks created are also named after four of the six phases of the CRISP-DM.

## Notebooks

- **00_data_understanding**: Examination of the dataset, relationships between features and between features and labels to increase data understanding.
- **01_data_preparation**: Investigation of the effects of different data preprocessing strategies.
- **02_modeling**: Model selection by cross-validation using different model types, data preprocessing strategies and hyperparameters.
- **03_evaluation_and_interpretation**: Evaluation of the performance of the selected model and interpretation of the model predictions.
